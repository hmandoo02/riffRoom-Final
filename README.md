        3. Add PostgreSQL's bin directory to the PATH environment variable:
        	- Find your file path (ex: C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin).
        	- Use the win + r shortcut to bring up the Run dialog and enter ```sysdm.cpl```.
        	- Select the Advanced tab at the top and click the ```Environment Variables``` button at the bottom.
        	- In environment variables you want to use the bottom section that says ```System```.
        	- Under ```System``` you want to find the ```Path``` variable and click on the ```Edit``` button.
        	- Once ```Edit``` is clicked you can click ```New``` and add your bin path ```C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin``` to the environment variable.
